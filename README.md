# NorthWind Graduation Project

This repository contains the work completed by the ITI Power BI Track (Q2) students from Mansoura for our graduation project focused on NorthWind Traders, a virtual company. Our goal was to apply the skills and tools acquired during the ITI program to deliver a detailed, end-to-end analysis and solution for NorthWind Traders.

## Introduction

The NorthWind database is a sample dataset originally developed by Microsoft to demonstrate database concepts. It represents the operations of NorthWind Traders, a fictitious company specializing in importing and exporting specialty foods globally. The database models a small-business ERP system, encompassing entities like customers, orders, inventory, suppliers, shipping, employees, and basic accounting.

Key entities in the NorthWind Traders database include:
- **Suppliers**: Vendors providing products.
- **Customers**: Buyers of NorthWind products.
- **Employees**: Staff managing operations.
- **Products**: Inventory details.
- **Shippers**: Logistics partners.
- **Orders and Order Details**: Sales transactions.

For a complete overview, refer to the documentation in the repository under `(1- Original Data Set CSV and ERD)`.

## Project Stages

### 1. Data Extraction from CSV Files
We began by analyzing NorthWind Traders' entities and crafting an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to understand the business structure:

![ERD Diagram Final](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cb2fdab-5fde-495a-90d3-6326b363ee16)

Using SSIS, we extracted data from 11 CSV files and loaded it into SQL Server:

![SSIS Data Load](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae4a6be2-8ffa-4960-9c96-2f4125f1a8e9)

The resulting database mapping is shown below:

*Further details are available in the documentation for this stage.*

### 2. Database Administration and Development
With the data loaded into an on-premises SQL Server, we enhanced performance, maintainability, and security through:

#### Stored Procedures
- **Total Created**: 49
- **Examples**:
  - `GetTopNExpensiveProducts`: Returns the top N most expensive products.
  - `GetInactiveCustomers`: Identifies customers inactive for a specified period.
  - `CustomerPerformance`: Tracks spending and order frequency.
  - `CustomerOrderHistoryOverYears`: Analyzes historical order trends.

#### Views
- **Total Created**: 28
- **Examples**:
  - `InventoryStatus`: Monitors stock levels (Critical, Low, Sufficient).
  - `CustomerOrderSummary`: Aggregates order data for performance tracking.
  - `AllInvoices`: Combines order, customer, and product details.
  - `BestSellingProducts`: Highlights top-performing products by sales volume.

#### Triggers
- **Total Created**: 13
- **Examples**:
  - `CheckStockBeforeOrder`: Prevents orders exceeding available stock.
  - `UpdateStockOnOrderInsert`: Adjusts inventory upon order placement.
  - `WarnLowStock`: Alerts when stock falls below a threshold.
  - `CheckStockOnOrder`: Ensures stock sufficiency during transactions.

#### Constraints
- **Total Created**: 15
- Enforced rules for data integrity and consistency.

#### Indexes
- **Total Created**: 5
- Optimized query performance on frequently accessed columns.

### 3. Data Warehouse Modeling and Implementation (On-Premises)
To enable business analysis, we designed a **Snowflake Schema** data warehouse for:
- Reduced redundancy
- Optimized storage
- Simplified maintenance
- Support for complex hierarchies (e.g., Employee-Territory relationships)

![Snowflake Schema](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b52de1d6-b8c4-49c5-bbc6-9a7d272366fd)

#### ETL from OLTP to OLAP
Using SSIS and SSMS, we transformed and loaded data into the OLAP system:
- **Dimensions ETL**:  
  ![Dimensions ETL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15e1d344-0de4-44c0-a93c-429cca8af21e)
- **Fact Table Incremental Load**:  
  ![OrderFactTable ETL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8467ea12-8e6b-4582-8afa-457c1bd54188)
- **Automated Pipeline**: SQL Server Jobs for scheduled updates  
  ![SQL Server Jobs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11b122cd-45aa-4fbf-b2cb-03b577c4f976)

*See documentation for additional details.*

### 4. On-Cloud Data Warehouse and ETL
Using **Azure SQL Database** and **Azure Data Factory**, we replicated the on-premises process in the cloud, achieving:
- 24/7 availability
- Automated pipelines handling:
  - Slowly Changing Dimensions
  - Incremental fact table updates
  - Hands-free operation via SQL Jobs
